    <p>Hello Aaron here and welcome to my website. This website will showcase just some of the HTML code that I used to build this site. Enjoy exploring and navigating around. So, who is Aaron Linson?</p>
    <p>Technology and music have always been a passion of mine. When I was little I used to read the manuals of toys when I was younger. That part of me still hasn't changed as I've become older and wiser now, in fact, I just read the manual for the new Zoom H6 Essential field recorder. When I'm not working with technology, I love to play music and listen to all types of music. I play various instruments, not all at the same time. Here is just a short sample list of the instruments I play.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Piano</li><li>Acoustic guitar</li><li>Bass guitar</li><li>Banjo</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> A journey of sight loss</h2>
    <p>I was born with a visual disability called ROP (Retinopathy Of Prematurity) which affects my right eye. My left eye I've never been able to see out of due to surgical mishaps as a baby. Due to those mishaps, I wear a glass eye in my left eye at all times. The glass eye keeps the facial bones in alignment with the right side of my face. So, that i don't look all frankinstein like when someone looks at me. Dispite the barriers put in front of me at a young age. I continued to persevere through all the challenges life throws at all of us who are disabled.</p>
    <p>I graduated college with my B.S in Music with a concentration in Audio Production and a minor in Communications from Indiana University Southeast. Shout out to the Grenadiers of 2017! You can read more about my professional journey by navigating to the <a href="contactpage.html">Contact page.</a></p><br>
    <p>Through my determination to not let my visual impairment stop me, my mom's insistance that I become independent and support from other family members. I learned how to navigate the world using a white cane and how to be an advocate for myself at a young age. This skill would come in handy during college and other areas of life. I also wanted to learn Braille so that I could read in the dark as I thought having that ability was cool. So, I fought my local school for the blind to teach me Braille, which they ended up teaching me. Without Braille, I couldn't have been as successful in college and my professional endeavors.</p>

    <h2> A journey to the dark side</h2>
    <p>On February 14th 2020 I noticed a change in my vision that was significant and would change my life in a way I never thought possible. Sure the opthomologist I was seeing at the time. Always reminded me that my vision could get worse and to be prepared. Well, you can mentally prepare yourself all you want however, when you loose a big majority of your vision that you relied upon for the past 20+ years of your life, nothing can prepare you for that amount of loss.</p><br>
    <p> I didn't realize how much I was using my vision in my right eye for instances such as spot checking when traveling with my cane. Or when placing my hands on a piano keyboard getting ready to play. Thankfully, I had a supportive family and friends to keep me going and my own determination that blindness isn't what defines me.</p>
    <p>I'm not goingn to lie and say it's been all sunshine and nothing affected me. I stopped playing piano for 5 years because I realized how much I used the vision I had to check my hand positioning and inheritently make sure I was moving to a different part of the keyboard for the next phrase. I loved cooking and while I still did a little bit I didn't do things I loved such as baking. However, I've gotten back into playing piano as time permits outside of work and, have started to bake and cook again.</p>
    <p>Blindness  or another disability or even multiple disabilities may affect your life. However, you define the life you want not the disability you have. Disabilities can happen to anyone for any reason at any time. You determine the next course of action.
